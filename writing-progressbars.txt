omnitrace progress bars:
- seperate crate, enable via feature in omnitrace
- local bar handlers
- tasks with one action inside

let task = omnitrace_task::task("Name", |task| {
	task.begin("Step 1", Some(10));
	for _ in 0..10 {
		task.step(1);
	}
	omnitrace_task::current().begin("Step 2", None);
	"result"
});
while let Some(event) = task.recv_event() {
	// process task event
}

no 'static-s: via transmute? unsafe if you mem::forget it

renderer api:
	event-based
		block until event (returns false on close)
		consume & return output
		current name / section
		pop previous sections (one-time)
	poll-based
		update function (non-block until event)
		consume & return output
		-> is still running?
		current name / section
		pop previous sections (one-time)
